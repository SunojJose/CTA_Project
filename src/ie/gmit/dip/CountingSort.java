	/**
	 * This implementation of the sort() does the counting sort.
	 * The procedure is as follows:
	 * 
	 * Determines the range of key
	 * Initializes a temporary array count[] of size range to store the occurrence of
	 * each unique element.
	 * Initializes an array, output[], of size numbers.length ( the size of the original
	 * array) to store the sorted output.
	 * Counts the occurrence of each unique element and stores the values in count[]
	 * The count[] is then modified in such a way that the indices of the elements
	 * store sum of previous counts.
	 * Stores the sorted elements in output[] in reverse order and decreasing count
	 * by 1 each time to ensure stability.
	 * Copies output[] to original numbers[].
	 * 
	 * Time complexity: For initializing and iteration of the second for loops 
	 * (for counting) it takes some constant, say k, time. 
	 * The other for loops iterates n, the length of the input array, times each. 
	 * Thus O(k) + O(n)--> O(k + n). 
	 * The behavior is same in all three cases.
	 * 
	 * Space Complexity: It requires k and n spaces 
	 * for storing the elements of the arrays
	 * and a few bits for initializing min, max, and key. 
	 * Therefore, O(k + n) is the space complexity.
