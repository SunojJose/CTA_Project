	 * This implementation of the sort() keeps two sub-arrays of the array of numbers;
	 * sub_array1 which is initially empty keeps all the sorted elements of numbers from left to right;
	 * sub_array2 which is initially the numbers itself keeps the elements to be sorted.
	 * 
	 * The local variable minimumIndex stores the index of the current smallest element in sub_array2;
	 * initially it is index 0, it replaces with the index value of the smallest element 
	 * in each comparison (when result is true) for each traversing of the sub_array2.
	 * 
	 * The local variable temp is used to swap elements after comparison 
	 * 
	 * The element at the minimumIndex is added to the end of sub_array1
	 * 
	 * When sorting completed sub_array1 contains the sorted elements of the numbers array;
	 * sub_array2 will be empty at the end of sorting.
	 * 
	 * Time complexity: O(n2) in all cases. Since there are (n-1) + (n-2)+ ... + 2 + 1 = (n-1) * n/2 comparisons
	 * and n-1 swaps per comparison.
	 * 
	 * Space complexity: O(1), it only requires to store two local variables.
